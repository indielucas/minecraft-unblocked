<p>Mine Blocks is a 2D Minecraft fan action game originally released in Flash. You can now play the game again, as it’s been rebuilt in HTML5 and features regular updates from the development team. Explore, craft, and create a world of your imaginings in this open-world playground!


<h2>How to Play Mine Blocks</h2>
<p>Mine Blocks shares many features with Minecraft, including the cool pixelated visual style. However, the game also introduces entirely new ideas. Mine Blocks has two principal game modes: survival and creative. More recently, the &quot;minigames&quot; tab was added to feature new game modes.</p>
<h3>Survival</h3>
<p>Collect various materials to craft shelter, weapons, and sustenance. The materials combine with others to create new items. For example, using wood and stone to craft a wooden axe. See the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://mineblocks.com/1/wiki/index.php?title=Crafting#Crafting_Recipes">crafting recipes </a>on the official wiki for more. Shelter and weapons are necessary to fight hostile mobs such as creepers, spiders, and zombies.</p>
<h3>Creative</h3>
<p>Creative mode is a sandbox where you’re free to roam and have unlimited resources at your disposal. You won’t lose health or die, and you can fly around the map by double-tapping ‘W’ or ‘Space’ to place blocks, items, and mobs wherever you please. In this mode, you can use your imagination to build epic structures, cities, worlds, and everything else.</p>
<h3>Join the scavenger hunt!</h3>
<p>As of update 1.31, you can join your friends in online multiplayer and complete the scavenger hunt to find all 10 items in 8 minutes before someone else does!</p>
