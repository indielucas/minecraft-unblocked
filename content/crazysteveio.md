<p>CrazySteve.io is an awesome multiplayer game based on the iconic Steve from Minecraft. In this game, Steve is holding a blasting competition and each player must work hard to try and be crowned king of the competition. Move around the map and collect the red bombs to create your TNT and the blue crystals to increase in size - you can plant 6 bombs at a time and you can push them in any direction you wish.


<p>Be sure to watch out for your own bombs and try to eliminate the other players by trapping them and destroying them with your TNT. How big can you grow? Can you become an immense Steve and reign as the champion of the blasting tournament?</p>
