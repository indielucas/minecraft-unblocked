<p>Minestrike.fun is a combination of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crazygames.com/game/evowarsio">EvoWars.io</a> with Minecraft characters. You can grow in size by eating cakes, cookies, and cooked fish. But be careful, as eating poisonous potatoes will reduce your experience and make you smaller. Survive by attacking smaller enemies or running away from larger ones. There are 15 levels, each with a different enemy to defeat. Can you reach the final level and become the strongest player in the game?
