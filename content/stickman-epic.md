<h2>How to Play Stickman Epic</h2>
<p>In Stickman Epic, your main goal is to clear each level by defeating zombies and bosses while constantly upgrading your hero. The game will start with a quick tutorial teaching you what your stickman is capable of. You will learn to walk left and right, easy enough. Other moves are jumps and double jumps—these are crucial to master as levels progress. The space bar is used to fight your opponent. Multiple clicks will do the job.</p>
<p>There are 15 chapters in Stickman Epic and they include:</p>
