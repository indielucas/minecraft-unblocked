<p>GrindCraft is a Minecraft-themed clicker game based on crafting. Collect various raw materials and climb the crafting ladder to create stronger items. Hover over craftable items to reveal the resources required to create them.


<h3>Craft, create, and automate</h3>
<h4>Harvest resources</h4>
<p>GrindCraft strips away the 3D world so you can focus solely on the crafting element of Minecraft. Starting with your fists, you can beat down trees for wood and start collecting resources just like in the survival mode of Minecraft.</p>
<h4>Build better tools</h4>
<p>From there, you can craft enough wood to build wooden tools like an axe and spade that make collecting resources easier. The rest is history. </p>
<p>The grind takes place in four click boxes. These are overworld, mine, food, and mobs. The variety of items you can harvest here depends on the gear you currently have. For example, it won’t show lava if you don’t have a bucket to collect it. GrindCraft will show raw mineable resources here at frequencies depending on their rarity.</p>
<h4>Hire villagers to work for you</h4>
<p>Once you get the resources to build a village, you can create villagers to drastically speed up the output by automating your operation.</p>
