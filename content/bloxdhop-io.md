<p>Bloxd.io is an IO adventure game featuring Minecraft graphics and various game modes. The game modes feature parkour, sandbox creativity, and combat, depending on which mode you choose to play.


<h2>How to Play Bloxd.io</h2>
<p>Bloxd.io is a sandbox game in which you navigate challenging obstacle courses by timing your jumps and movements accurately. In survival mode, you gather resources, craft tools, and fend off enemies to stay alive. There are several game modes to choose from to start the game, each with a variety of challenges.</p>
<h3>Bloxd.io Game Modes</h3>
<p>Choose from one of the many game modes to begin your Bloxd.io journey.</p>
<h4>BloxdHop.io</h4>
<p>In the BloxdHop game mode your mission is to reach the end of the map within the given timeframe. To reach the end, you must hop through the level parkour-style onto blocks of various sizes.</p>
<h4>DoodleCube</h4>
<p>This game mode is similar to drawing games like Gartic.io. Players create objects based on the theme presented, and other users vote on how representative they are of that object.</p>
<h4>EvilTower</h4>
<p>The mission is to reach the top of the Evil Tower! Similar to BloxdHop, you use your parkour skills to reach the end. EvilTower is inspired by Robloxâ€™s Tower of Hell.</p>
<h4>Peaceful</h4>
<p>Peaceful mode is like creative mode in Minecraft. You can roam freely collecting resources and building here.</p>
