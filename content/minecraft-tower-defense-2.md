<p>Minecraft Tower Defense 2 is a tower defense game based on the ever-popular Minecraft. In this game, you are protecting your home from all the different and dangerous creatures of the Minecraft world, which includes creepers, wolves, and zombies. Your first goal is to get to your destination by making a path towards it. This path is the same path that the creatures will take to get to you (some stages will have pre-made paths that you need to be wary of as well). Once you&#39;re done, you have to put in your defenses to make sure your home is safe - if a set number of creatures reach your home, it&#39;s game over. Use your resources wisely to make sure you get through the night alive!
