<p>Build and Crush is a multiplayer game in which you can, you guessed it, build and crush stuff. Choose your own fun!


<h2><strong>How to Play Build and Crush</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Build</strong></p>
<p>Place blocks or animals to build something cool. There are normal blocks (bricks, granite, glass, wood, leaves, etc.) and color blocks. Each block can have multiple variations: column, stair, and triangle. Don&#39;t forget to save what you build, and when you are happy with it, you can make your creation public with a single click on the &quot;Make public&quot; button. </p>
<p><strong>Crush</strong></p>
<p>This is where the fun begins. Select a random creation, and use the various weapons to blow everything up. Explode everything with TNT, shoot it with a cannon, trigger an earthquake, or put everything on fire! Pst, if you want a 1-click annihilation, use the atomic bomb ;) A real-time multiplayer mode will also arrive soon, where you can compete against other players, defend from zombies, and do other cool stuff!</p>
<p><strong>Multiplayer:</strong> Work together with other players in various game modes.</p>
