<h3>Blocks</h3>
<p>Each block in Voxiom.io has different properties. Some blocks are harder to break than others. Players can only use the shovel to harvest blocks. Ore blocks are special blocks that drop gems, which can be used in crafting. The blocks physics system in the game ensures that floating blocks get destroyed when mining.</p>
<h3>Map</h3>
