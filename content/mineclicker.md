<p>MineClicker is a non-endless clicker game set in the Minecraft universe. Click to kill mobs and mine blocks. Earn XP and gather stone to buy various upgrades and hire recruits to make <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crazygames.com/t/idle">idling</a> easier.


<h3>Fight various MineClicker mobs</h3>
<p>Slay <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crazygames.com/t/minecraft">Minecraft</a> mob characters one by one to earn experience points. You can spend those shiny points on new recruits, and on upgrades for your existing personnel. Each hire has mob and block DPS stats that allow you to destroy things faster. These get much higher on recruits later in the game when the difficulty increases.</p>
<h3>Buy weapons to defeat the mobs</h3>
<p>In the weapon upgrades screen you can purchase and upgrade your weapons. Just like Minecraft there is a progression to stronger gear, starting with your hands and wooden implements. You buy weapons using stone pieces which are earned by destroying blocks.</p>
<h3>Level up to earn more</h3>
<p>As you go further in MineClicker, the mobs and blocks will level up. You can level up by beating boss levels where the mob boss will have a timer. If you canâ€™t kill them in time, their health resets.</p>
<p>You can choose which level to stick with until the time is right to move up the ranks. Leveling up means more cash per block destroyed or mob member killed, but as always with clicker games, the cost of new items increases too!</p>
